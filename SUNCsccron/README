HA-Cron: A high availability agent for Cron

Version: 1.0.0



1.Installation

1.1 Installing from the source:

You may download the latest source form haron.dev.java.net. Once you've done so, simply copy the SUNCsccron folder to /opt :

	#: cd <path-to-SUNCsccron-folder>
	#: cp -r SUNCsccron /opt


2. Usage

2.1. Create a file and add the RG specific cron entries to it.

2.2. To add the Cron resource to a resource group, just edit the file in /opt/SUNCsccron/utils/cron_config, and modify the following parameters accordingly:

a) RS : This is the name of your HA-Cron resource when you add it to the RG.
b) RG : This is the name of the resource group into which you're going to add HA-Cron to.
c) RGCRONTAB : This is the path to the RG specific crontab file where the user specifies all the jobs specific to the resource group that is to be kept highly available.

2.3. If you don't wish to view any debug details, you can set the DEBUG option in /opt/SUNCsccron/etc/config to blank. For debug info, set DEBUG to ALL.

2.4. The next step would be to register the resource. You can do that by running the cron_register script present in the util directory:

	#: /opt/SUNCsccron/util/cron_register
